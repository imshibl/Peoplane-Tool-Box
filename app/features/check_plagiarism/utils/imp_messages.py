    "Our SOP plagiarism checker is designed to identify similarities in content, but it's essential to note that a small database may result in common matches. Don't be alarmed if some similarities are detected; focus on ensuring the majority of your content is unique and reflective of your own thoughts and experiences.",
    "While our SOP plagiarism checker is effective, it's common for certain phrases or sentences to appear in multiple SOPs. However, it's crucial to avoid outright copying of entire SOPs. Aim to maintain the authenticity of your statement by expressing your unique motivations, experiences, and goals in your own words.",
    "Consider using our checker as a tool to enhance your originality rather than just detecting potential plagiarism. Use it as an opportunity to refine your writing, ensuring that your SOP truly reflects your individual aspirations and achievements.",
    "Our database may be small, but our commitment to academic integrity is paramount. We continuously update and expand our database to improve the accuracy of our plagiarism detection. Your feedback is valuable in this process, and we encourage you to report any false positives or suggest additional sources for our database.",
    "Remember that SOPs are meant to be personal reflections of your journey and aspirations. Even if similarities are detected, it's essential to focus on conveying your unique story. Use the results from our checker as guidance to refine and strengthen your SOP, making it a true representation of your individuality.",
    "If you come across instances of potential plagiarism, take the opportunity to revisit and revise your SOP. Use our tool not just for plagiarism detection but as a valuable resource for self-improvement in crafting an authentic and compelling statement.",
    "While our database is growing, we recommend complementing our tool with your own diligence. Review and cross-check your SOP with academic guidelines and resources, ensuring that it meets the specific requirements of the institution or program you are applying to.",
    "As you use our SOP plagiarism checker, keep in mind that it's a supportive tool in your application process. Use it to refine your SOP, but also seek feedback from mentors, professors, or colleagues to ensure your statement is compelling and meets the standards of your intended audience.",
